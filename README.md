# Reputation-Odyssey
The Ultimate Game Reputation Backpack for Players. This innovative tool allows players to import and utilize their game reputation in any supported game seamlessly. Reputation-Odyssey showcases the power of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) with Hypersign SSI SDK, providing a secure and decentralized solution.


## Tech Used
Our platform harnesses the power of Hypersign SSI SDK, empowering users with a wide range of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) capabilities. Each Gamer Profile is uniquely assigned a Decentralized Identifier (DID), which is seamlessly registered on the blockchain. Moreover, the platform facilitates the issuance of score credentials and enhances security by utilizing the Encrypted Data Vault (EDV) SDK to securely store Verifiable Credentials (VC) within the user's personal Vault (EDV).
